#I Like Clean Code

This really shouldn't be a surprise, 99.9% of developers will say the same thing. THOugh it wasn't untill about a year or two ago that I fully realized _Why_ I like clean code.

Sure properly formated code is easier to read but this is just one aspect of what I consider *clean* code - especially when considering development in the WordPress world. I have heard the WordPress is to PHP as jQuery is to JavaScript and at a philisphical level I agree.  WordPres - just like jQuery - has a set of Core functions that leverage PHP and Database calls to make the developer's job easier - just like jQuery's Core functions. It is because of this that when developing in a WordPress environment that we _must_ use as much Core functionality as possible.

But let us go a little futher with what _clean_ code is.  Clean code also refers to _maintainable_ code and this is key.  Whether you are doing product, client, or personal work your code needs to be maintained. When working on product or client work a developer is rarely working alone and must share code with co-workers, on-board new developers to a project, or go back and look at code that is months ( or years ) old. Having standards in place make these tasks so much more easy. In a perfect work then, on any given project, we should be able to look at code and _not_ be able to tell which developer wrote it because we are all coding the the same style.

Ok, so now we are all coding the same ( in a prefect world ) but this is still only a part of _clean code_.  Another aspect specific to WordPress is _how_ we organize our code. Let's take a custom page template for example, and let's assume this page template has 4 different queries on it.  When first starting to work with WordPress I had a snippet of a basic wp_query, and in our example, I would use the same snippet 4 different times - and this works, it works just fine. I still see this regularly when looking at a beginning developers code when chatting at WordCamps or online and this is one situation that is a perfect teachable moment.

Many developers in the WordPress space are self-taught ( I certainly am ).  This is great becuase it means that this individual went out of their way for one reason or another to learn something! But, often this learning happens isolated from others that code and without access to one-on-one guidance from more experienced developers.  The first time I show a developer how to remove the queries that they are runnign 4 time with only one minor change their eyes always light up :)

And this brings us to antoher topic on clean code - the seperation of *logic* from *display*.  Logic refers to the actual data that we will be showing and this can end up get very complicated so keeping your *logic* code out of your *display* code is a must.  Display code on the other hand handles what your data look like on the users screen - this would include HTML / JS / CSS etc... Wehn working on teams there are often individuals with specialties and keeping this code seperate also helps with workflow.  THe front-end developer doesnt need to be digging through PHP `if` statements to find when to update a class, and the back-end developers should be considering final output of data before it is necessary.  Lastly seperating your logic from your output will also help with git merge confklict issues saving time here as well.

##Plugins
Now I amlost exculsively work on client projects.  This means that I mainly build custom themes for clients and I dont consider much what would happen if said client switches themes.  This is because they hired my employer to _build a custom solution for them_ and they realize that. To this end, I believe plugins should be kept to as few as possible for a few reasons:

1. Security: if you didn't write the code, _you_ cannot guarentee its' quality
2. Data: Many plugins will result in data being stored in different areas on the database ( or even creating their own tables ).  On the serface this doesn't seem like an issue though let me tell you - When you have to dig thorugh a Database just to find which of the 40 plugins installed is controlling a setting you will waste a lot of time.
3. Project maintanability and customization: If you didn't write the code, you can't maintain it.

Let us look at #3 in more detail. We all know that plugins can be great though rearly get us to 100% of what a client actually wants.  This means either the client conceeds on features, or you ( as the developer ) needs to somehow alter a plugins functionality. In the best cases, the plugin in question will have the hooks and filters that you need to do custom work - though often this is not the case leaving you with the worst option, *hacking the plugin*.
