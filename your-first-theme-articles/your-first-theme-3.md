#Your First Theme - Part 3

In part two of this series we end with having made a header.php, footer.php, and template-part/post-loop.php to show our most recent posts on index.php ( our home page ).  In this article will will add some more markup (html), get some basic styles in place, and a custom sidebar.

We have also skipped some very important things that WordPress needs to work correctly so let's start with these as they are super simple...

First open up your header.php file and find the the closing `</head>` tag.  Just before this tag we are going to add the php function `wp_head()` so header.php should now look like:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
	<head>
	<title></title>
	<?php wp_head(); ?>
	</head>
	<body>
		<div class="wrapper">
			<div class="content">
```

wp_head() is a crucial function as it allows us, plugins, and WordPress Core to add links and scripts to the header itself.  If you've noticed, while we do have a style.css file, it is not actually being used in our html markup - but don't worry we'll be getting to that today.

Similarly to wp_head(), there is also the `wp_footer()` function which I'm sure you hvae already guessed goes in footer.php, which will now look like:

```
			</div><!--end content-->
			<footer>
			</footer>
		</div><!--end wrapper-->
		<?php wp_footer(); ?>
	</body>
</html>
```

wp_footer() basically does the exact same thing as wp_head() as it allows us, plugins, and WordPress core to add scripts (and in theory styles) to the footer of our theme.

##Post-loop.php markup
Let us turn our attention back to template-parts/post-loop.php which currently only has `<h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>` in it.  We'll start by wrapping everything in an `<article>` tag as well as adding two more empty `<divs>` under the `<h2>` title - give the first `<div>` the class of `author` and the second the class of `excerpt`.  The file show now look like:

```
<article>
	<h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
	<div class="author"></div>
	<div class="excerpt"></div>
</article>
```

WordPress provides us with a number of functions to help output our data.  The two that we now need are `<?php the_author(); ?>` and `<?php the_excerpt(); ?>`. Place each of these funcitons in side the appropriate `<div>` like:

```
<div class="author"><?php the_author(); ?></div>
<div class="excerpt"><?php the_excerpt(); ?></div>
```

It is also time to start following some basic WordPress conventions.  WordPress themes typically allow us to target content via unique classes that each page or post have.  To allow for this we will update the opening `<article>` tag to look like:

```
<article id="post-<?php the_ID(); ?>" <?php post_class(); ?>>
```

Here `the_ID()` will display the specific ID of each post and `post_class()` will display a number of different classes to help target different post types should you want to. Go ahead and make sure everything is saved and refreash your site. Some default browser styling should now take effect due `<p>` tags that are output because of the `the_excerpt()` function that we added.

Ok - lets move on to doing a little styling work in style.css.  If you have not already done so - go ahead and clear out any remain information for twentyfifteen, such as:

```
/*
Theme Name: My cool theme
Theme URI:
Author:
Author URI:
Description:
Version:
License: GNU General Public License v2 or later
License URI: http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html
Tags:

This theme, like WordPress, is licensed under the GPL.
Use it to make something cool, have fun, and share what you've learned with others.
*/
```

You can fill the information out that I removed if you like but it is not required for us right now.

Then Adding...

```
* {
	box-sizing: border-box;
}

html,
body {
	margin: 0;
	padding: 0;
}

.wrapper {
	max-width: 960px;
	margin: 0 auto;
	padding: 0;
}
```

Will give a basic stucture to work with but of course we haven't even added our style sheet to our header yet - we'll do that now.

The correct way to include stylesheets in WordPress is to _enqueue_ them (https://codex.wordpress.org/Function_Reference/wp_enqueue_style). We do this in functions.php, and this is where I start to be opinionated about _how_ themes should be built. Functions.php should be seen as a file that references _other files via a `require_once()` call OR should only include WordPress Core functions the _set up_ your theme such as enqueuing styles and scripts.  Functions.php _is not_ for custom functions, that is what the `require_once()` is for that I just mentioned.  Using this approach your function.php file will remain shorter and easier to navigate while any files that you will eventaully `require_once()` in functions.php will be much easier to navigate and read as well.  If this is confusing at this point, that is perfectly fine, we will be creating a custom query in our next article where this will be demonstrated.  For the mean time your functions.php file should look like:

```
<?php

add_action( 'wp_enqueue_scripts', 'my_cool_theme_scripts' );
function my_cool_theme_scripts() {
	wp_enqueue_style( 'your-cool-theme-styles', get_stylesheet_uri() );
}

?>
```

Let translate this into english so we can see what's actually happening. First we see a function called `add_action` - this is a core part of how we work with WordPress.  Here we are sending it two arguments. The first, `wp_enqueue_scripts` is an _action hook_ - it tells WordPress _when_ to do something.  The second argument, `my_cool_theme_scripts` is the _function name_ of what we are going to do.  A even more plain english example of this may be:

```
<?php
add_action( 'when_at_the_store', 'buy_milk' );
function buy_milk() {
	// stuff i need to do to buy milk here
}
?>
```

Then you'll see the `my_cool_theme_scripts` function itself.  Don't let the word `scripts` confuse you here, the function can really be call anything as long as it is referred to correctlyin our `add_action` call though since stylesheets and javascript scripts are typically added at the same time you will often find them enqueued in the same function.

Ok, so inside our `my_cool_theme_scripts` function you'll see yet another function from WordPress Core called `wp_enqueue_style` which is also getting two arguments.  Here the first argument the _handle_ of our stylesheet, all you need to know right now about this is that it should be *unique* so it is often prefixed (i.e. just add your theme name to the beginning of the handle) with your theme name. The second argument is the actual location of our stylesheet.  WordPress has the function `get_stylesheet_uri()' which literally look for the file `style.css` in the root of your theme - so in this case this is all we need here.

If everything has gone well (and you've saved style.css and functions.php) when you refresh the frontend of your site you should now see our basic styles taking effect.

##Sidebars!
In these artices we will be doing things a little more custom than most - and it is because of this that we will build a custom sidebar that does not use WordPress' core widgets or any other plugins.

Let us start by making room for our side bar.  In our header.php we open the html tag `<div class="content">` though since we cannot be certain that every page will require or want a sidebar this is not an appropriate place to account for the new html we need to put in place.

Rather, we will add this logic to index.php as this is currently our only page template.

Our first step will be updating index.php to:

```
<?php
get_header();

if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

	<div class="content-left">
		<?php
		// Start the loop.
		while ( have_posts() ) {
			// WordPress core function to set up post data
			the_post();

			// Our template which we use for each post
			get_template_part( 'template-parts/post', 'loop' );
		}
		// End the loop.
		?>
	</div>

<?php else :
	// no content template part will go here
endif;

get_footer();
?>
```

Note that we are now using a `:` (colon) syntax for the `if` statment, which is ended with `endif;` rather than a closing bracket.  This is a little of my opinion - when leaving php during a logic check (i.e. a `if` or `while` statement) the `:` syntax should be used and when staying within php the `{}` (bracket) syntax should be used. So here, because we are leaving php to add our `<div class="content-left">` we are using the `:` syntax though in our `while` statement we are not leaving php so we are using the `{}` syntax.

Now let's add some css to style.css to account for where our sidebar will be:

```
.content-left {
	width: 70%;
	float: left;
	background-color: #ccc;
}
```

This should do the trick (note: the background color is only to help us identify our divs).

Next we need to wrap our to-be sidebar in a div and create a template file for it. Updating index.php to this will work for our needs:

```
<?php
get_header();

if ( have_posts() ) : ?>

	<div class="content-left">
		<?php
		// Start the loop.
		while ( have_posts() ) {
			// WordPress core function to set up post data
			the_post();

			// Our template which we use for each post
			get_template_part( 'template-parts/post', 'loop' );
		}
		// End the loop.
		?>
	</div>

	<div class="content-right">
		<?php get_template_part( 'template-parts/sidebar', 'right' ); ?>
	</div>

<?php else :
	// no content template part will go here
endif;

get_footer();

?>
```

And your next task will be to create the file sidebar-right.php with in the template-parts directory. Feel free to add some random text inside this new file to make sure it is loading correctly. If it is loading you should see your random text showing below the list of our posts.

Once you have the random text from sidebar-right.php showing, go ahead add add this css to style.css:

```
.content-right {
	width: 30%;
	float: right;
	background-color: #bada55;
}
```

Once your `template-parts/sidebar-right.php` file is loading correctly we will add the defualt loop to it to get some content to work with, so sidebar-right.php should be updated to now be:

```
<?php

// Start the loop.
while ( have_posts() ) {
	// WordPress core function to set up post data
	the_post();

	// Our template which we use for each post
	get_template_part( 'template-parts/post', 'loop' );
}
// End the loop.
?>
```

Now in you left and right divs you should be seeing the same list of your most recent 10 posts.  This is a good place to stop for now.  In our next post we will be getting more serious about wp_query and digging into how to customize the list of posts that it returns.
